        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <h2>Prashanth Neel's KGF, which stars Yash in the lead, has become arguably the most spoken about Kannada film, which has been dubbed in Tamil, nationally. The expectations have been enormous. Does the team deliver? Yes, they do. The film has a fast-paced
            first half,
            <p>which does seem a little long,</p>
            but the <q>second half</q> and the climax set up the right premise for the second part of the film.</h2>
